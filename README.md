# wasm-nn: A Deep Learning Framework for WebAssembly

wasm-nn is a deep learning framework for WebAssembly (Wasm) that allows you to train and deploy neural networks in the browser or on the server. It has Python bindings that are compatible with PyTorch, so you can use your existing PyTorch code and models with wasm-nn.

## Features

- Compiles and runs on Wasm for fast and efficient execution
- Python bindings for easy integration with PyTorch
- Supports a wide range of layer types and optimization algorithms
- Easy to use and well-documented API
